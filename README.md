This repository includes the entire Rescue B project from 2013, used in the international RoboCup Rescue B league.

There is an old version (android based) of it (on the picture, the 2012 one), find out more [here](https://github.com/ivanseidel/Robot-Rescue-2012).

This robot uses two Arm Cortex M3 and one Atmega328. All the code is written in C++, using using Interfaces, and Classes hierarchy to provide well encapsulated code, and easy to use.

Because our team was participating at the same time on the Soccer Junior B league too, we couldn't finish it's code completely, but Mechanics, Hardware and Firmware part was 100% completed. Here is the [Soccer project repository](https://github.com/ivanseidel/Robot-Soccer-2013).

The image bellow is a picture/render of the real robot, and it's project rendered in SolidWorks.
